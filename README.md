    "database_name" : "postgres",
    "user_name" : "postgres", # default postgres user name
    "password" : "admin1", 
    "port" : "localhost:5432" # default postgres port
}
```

4. if Sqlite is to be used, uncomment the below in models.py and comment the postgres database url

database_filename = "database.db"
project_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
database_path = "sqlite:///{}".format(os.path.join(project_dir, database_filename))
